# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Strands Agent is a real-time information assistant that combines conversational AI capabilities with live web data retrieval through Google Search API integration. The agent intelligently routes queries that require current information to web search, processes the results, and provides concise, summarized answers to users. This enables the agent to handle dynamic information requests such as current pricing, recent news, certification deals, and other time-sensitive data that cannot be pre-stored in a static knowledge base.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about current information that may not be in the agent's knowledge base, so that I can get up-to-date answers without manually searching the web.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL analyze whether the query requires real-time information
2. WHEN the system determines a query needs current data THEN the system SHALL route the query to the Google Search API
3. WHEN search results are retrieved THEN the system SHALL process and summarize the top results
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return a concise, natural language response to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to provide accurate and relevant search results, so that I can trust the information provided without needing to verify it myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search THEN the system SHALL retrieve at least the top 5 search results
2. WHEN processing search results THEN the system SHALL extract relevant information from result snippets and titles
3. WHEN multiple sources contain similar information THEN the system SHALL synthesize the information into a coherent summary
4. WHEN conflicting information is found THEN the system SHALL indicate uncertainty or present multiple perspectives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to handle both static knowledge questions and real-time search queries seamlessly, so that I have a consistent conversational experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL determine whether to use static knowledge or perform a web search
2. WHEN using static knowledge THEN the system SHALL respond directly without external API calls
3. WHEN switching between static and search-based responses THEN the system SHALL maintain conversational context
4. WHEN unable to find relevant information THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative queries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times for my queries, so that the conversational flow feels natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a static knowledge query THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN performing a web search THEN the system SHALL complete the search and summarization within 10 seconds
3. WHEN API calls fail or timeout THEN the system SHALL fallback to static knowledge or inform the user of the issue
4. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them without significant performance degradation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the Google Search API integration, so that I can customize search behavior and manage API usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the agent THEN the system SHALL require valid Google Search API credentials
2. WHEN configuring search parameters THEN the system SHALL allow customization of result count, language, and region
3. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling or caching
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to cite sources for search-based information, so that I can verify the information if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing search-based answers THEN the system SHALL include source URLs or website names
2. WHEN multiple sources are used THEN the system SHALL indicate which information came from which source
3. WHEN presenting summarized information THEN the system SHALL maintain traceability to original sources
4. WHEN sources are unavailable or unreliable THEN the system SHALL indicate the limitation to the user
